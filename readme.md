CHC Consent
The vision of Born in Bradford 4 All (BIB4A) is to investigate the causes of childhood illness by studying children from all cultures and backgrounds as their lives unfold by using data from multiple agencies, including NHS, social care and education.
This Consent Project is to facilitate the use of data by administrating the consent given by mothers (on behalf of their children) during pregnancy for the lifecycle of the BIB4A project, and the management of that consent over the course of the study.
